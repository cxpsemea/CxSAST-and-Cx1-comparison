Small collection of Powershell scripts that can be used to compare a CxSAST environment with a CheckmarxOne environment.

- Compare Presets: can be used to compare the queries that are enabled in a preset, for example comparing an on-prem "Checkmarx Default" with a CheckmarxOne "Checkmarx Default". This script will generate a CSV file showing the queries that are common to and different between both presets.
- Compare Queries: can be used to compare the corporate-level custom queries. This script will generate a CSV file showing the CxSAST environment Corporate queries and comparing them with CheckmarxOne Tenant queries, to help identify queries that may need to be (re)migrated or otherwise synchronized between the environments. This script will also output a "mappings.json" file that can be used by the sast-to-ast-export process to ensure that queries and triages are migrated correctly.
- Compare Scans: can be used to compare the results of a scan in CxSAST with the results in CheckmarxOne. This will show findings common between both environments, findings that are in the CxSAST environment but not in CheckmarxOne, and findings that are new in CheckmarxOne but not in the CxSAST scan. 
- Compare Mappings: can be used to compare two "query mappings.json" files to review the output generated by the "Compare Queries" script against another mappings.json file.
